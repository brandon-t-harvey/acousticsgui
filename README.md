# acousticsgui
Java Swing library for controls that work with acoustics concepts

This is a bare bones library that may never grow; it's a parking place for leftover Swing controls that I didn't delete after converting everything to JavaFX. Rather than throw them out, I am posting them here, and perhaps eventually I will backport the fxacousticsgui material to Swing.
